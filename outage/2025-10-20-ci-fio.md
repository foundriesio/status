## 2025-10-20 Foundries CI Infrastructure Outage

Our CI jobs were failing between 2025-10-20 08:00 UTC and 2025-10-20 ~14:30 UTC due to an upstream disruption in the Docker Hub service.

### Timeline of Events
- **2025-10-20 08:00 UTC** â€“ CI jobs began failing to spawn containers and complete pipelines.  
- **2025-10-20 10:45 UTC** â€“ We determined the root cause to be a global Docker service outage.  
- **2025-10-20 ~14:15 UTC** â€“ Docker reported full recovery of their service.  
- **2025-10-20 ~14:30 UTC** â€“ CI pipelines resumed normal operations and all backlog was cleared.

### Impact
- CI jobs that rely on Docker Hub failed ~08:00 and ~14:15 UTC.  
- Builds/tests that require containerized environments were blocked in this window.  
- No data loss or compromise of customer builds; only availability was impacted.

### Root cause
An upstream outage in the Docker Hub service prevented our CI runners from launching or interacting with containers until the service was restored by the vendor.

### Resolution and next steps
- Once Docker confirmed their service was healthy, we verified our CI pipelines and cleared the backlog.  
- We are reviewing our fallback options for CI jobs that require containers hosted in Docker Hub, to reduce exposure to upstream service outages.  
- Weâ€™ll update this page with any further findings if our post-incident review surfaces additional actions.
