## Compute cluster upgrade

On Sat, 2023-12-30 and Sun, 2023-12-31, compute cluster will be upgraded.

Our infrastructure team will upgrade control-plane components and some [foundries.io](https://foundries.io) services.  
During the maintenance, OTA and CI systems might have service interruption (expected downtime - less than 5 minutes).
Docker registry [hub.foundries.io](https://hub.foundries.io) might be unavailable up to 10 minutes.  
Performance of some [foundries.io](https://foundries.io) services might be impacted during the maintenance.
