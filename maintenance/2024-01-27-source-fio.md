## source.foundries.io maintenance

On Sun, 2024-01-27 between 02:00 and 04:00 UTC Foundries.io team will be performing scheduled maintenance on the main source-code service [source.foundries.io](https://source.foundries.io).

During the maintenance, service might be unavailable up to 30 minutes for any operations: read and write (pull and push).
CI system might be affected as well: jobs will timed out or be cancelled, and will need to be restarted manually after the maintenance.

We apologize for any inconveniences generated by these service interruptions.
